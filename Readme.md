# 🚀 IoTEmulator

## 🌍 Overview

**IoTEmulator** is an advanced simulation platform for smart home automation, integrating **ESP32** with **ThingsBoard**. It enables seamless communication and control of various home devices using **ESP-NOW, RFID, and Infrared (IR)** technology. This project provides a fully interactive environment where devices can be remotely monitored and managed through a custom **rule chain**.

## ✨ Features

- 🏠 **Smart Home Simulation**: Includes multiple instances like rooms, living areas, garage, kitchen, and entryways.
- 🎛 **Device Control**: Manage lights, TVs, doors, alarms, and more.
- 📡 **Wireless Communication**: Uses **ESP-NOW, RFID, and IR** for a low-latency and efficient control mechanism.
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrated with **ThingsBoard** for dynamic visualization and remote management.

## 🔧 Requirements

- **ESP32** with ESP-NOW, RFID, and IR modules
- **ThingsBoard** for IoT visualization and telemetry processing
- **Angular** (for frontend smart home simulation)
- **MQTT broker** for message handling
